# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Overview  
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters to help businesses better understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Key Features  
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated customer data with 200 samples.  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization of features for better clustering performance.  
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- **Clustering**: Applied K-Means to segment customers into clusters.  
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot to visualize clusters based on customer features.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Libraries:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `scikit-learn`
